# Mini-Project
Image Classification
classified an image taken from wellington harbour somewhere by separating he image into segments
assigned segments to one of 5 classes from supplied training data (water, grass, vegetation, concrete, buildings)
used three different classification schemes to segment the image
The aim of this mini project was to test classificaion schemes
created code to semi automate this process
training data had to be supplied
we created a new g420 environment with new packages
