# Mini Project - Image Classification

The aim of this mini project was to test object-based land cover classificaion schemes using python, semi automating the process.

Packages used were added to the g420 environment.

An orthophoto of the Wellington waterfront was downloaded from LINZ (30cm pixel resolution) for classification.

A training data shape file for the image was created using QGIS with 5 classes assigned (water, grass, vegetation, concrete, buildings).

Three different classification schemes were used to segment the image. These include Slic, Quickshift, and Felzenszwalb.
